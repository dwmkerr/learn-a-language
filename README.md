Learn a Language
================

If you're learning a new programming language or framework, it's important to have a project or exercise to perform that gives you a chance to put the language through it's paces - Hello World generally doesn't cut it.

This repo is a description of some ideas of such projects - please fork, pull request and add to the list!

1. [Pascal's Triangle](#pascals-triangle)
2. [Langton's Ant](#langtons-ant)

Pascal's Triangle
-----------------

tl;dr - Basic and perfect for day one of a new language.

One of the best - [Pascel's Triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle) is a simple mathematical construct that you should be able to implement quickly in almost any language. The sort of output you'd be looking for would be:

````

How many lines? 5

1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1
````

What should this teach?
* Basic mathematical functions of the language.
* Console or process input
* Console or file ouput
* Recursion or looping

Langton's Ant
-------------

tl;dr - Hard, great opportunities to be clever and use language specific features.

[Langton's Ant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langtons_ant) is another mathematical simulation. In the simulation you create a basic universe with a few rules and let it run - it's quite similar to [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

A screenshot of such an application, written in Javascript would look like this:

(This project is on GitHub at [github.com/dwmkerr/langtonsant](https://github.com/dwmkerr/langtonsant)).

What should this teach?
* More complex collections
* State management
* Console or process input
* Console, graphical or file output
* Basic algorithms.
