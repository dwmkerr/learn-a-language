Learn a Language
================

If you're learning a new programming language or framework, it's important to have a project or exercise to perform that gives you a chance to put the language through it's paces - Hello World generally doesn't cut it.

This repo is a description of some ideas of such projects - please fork, pull request and add to the list!

Pascal's Triangle
-----------------

One of the best - [Pascel's Triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle) is a simple mathematical construct that you should be able to implement quickly in almost any language. The sort of output you'd be looking for would be:

````

How many lines? 5

1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1
````

What should this teach?
* Basic mathematical functions of the language.
* Console or process input
* Console or file ouput
* Recursion or looping
